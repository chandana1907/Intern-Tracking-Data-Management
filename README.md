# Intern Tracking Data Management

## ðŸ“ŒScenario:

As part of a project to manage intern performance data, I was tasked with setting up a basic database structure. The goal? To create a solid foundation that could later support performance dashboards, login systems, and task tracking features.

## ðŸ’¡Learning Outcome: 

Instead of just reading theory, I got to create and manage my own databaseâ€”understanding how to structure real-world data for future analysis and reporting.

## ðŸ§  What I learned:

- Importance of setting up clean relationships between tables

- Using AUTO_INCREMENT and FOREIGN KEY for referential integrity

- Keeping structures scalable and easy to maintain
